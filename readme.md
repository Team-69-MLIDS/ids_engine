- Git clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv ./venv` *everything should be ran using the virtual environment - not the system install of python*
- Run `./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages in the virtual environment
- `run.sh` executes `lccde/lccde.py` in the virtual environment
