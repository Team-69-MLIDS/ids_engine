# Get started
- Git clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv ./venv` *everything should be ran using the virtual environment - not the system install of python*
- Run `. ./venv/bin/activate` to set your shell to use the venv 
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages in the virtual environment
- `run.sh` executes `lccde/lccde.py` in the virtual environment
- Before working on the project, make sure to run `. ./venv/bin/activate` to adjust your current shell so that you do not need to use the ./venv prefix 

LCCDE algorithm is the algorithm we care about according to the professor.
